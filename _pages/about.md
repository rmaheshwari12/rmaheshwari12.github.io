I am a student of data science, working close to 3 years with data as a business analyst data analyst and now data scientist! I enjoy unpacking complex problems and have proven competency to solve business problems. I have worked with diverse teams across the globe and implemented several projects with effective communication and time management. I can communicate data to business and can frame business problems into technical framework to get the answers from the data.

Also, I enjoy cooking and watching/playing baseball ! #GoYankees
